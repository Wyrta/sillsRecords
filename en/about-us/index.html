                Since 2018, Sills Records is engaged in France’s independent artists community in order to create qualitative content in harmonious conditions. Indeed, the purpose of our content is independent of the monetary and temporal restrictions common in bigger labels.            </p>
            <p>
                Located at Mésanger, in France, Sills Records began as a rehearsal room for the band Samatic and gained in size following the firsts EPs of the band Nemesis Bank.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to our wide range of services of recording, mixing, mastering, publishing and managing, Sills Records has gained power among the local labels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sills Records is fully associated to the art independentism movement, as evidenced by the original and unrivalled resultant.
            </p>
